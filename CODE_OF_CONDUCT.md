# Code of Conduct

The Glasgow Coder Collective (hereby referred to as gCC or The Collective) is an organisation intended for networking, education, and community. To ensure it is a welcoming and friendly environment for those involved, all members, speakers, organisers and volunteers at any meetup are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the meetup and meetup-related social events.

Reporting Issues
If you experience any issues during a gCC event please get in touch with an organiser or administrator of the Facebook Group.

SUMMARY
The Glasgow Coder Collective is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of group participants, visitors of the venue or event staff in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any group venue, including talks and workshops.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the group.

IN DETAIL
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and inappropriate attempts to solicit private information from other members. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Organisers and sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a group administrator.

Organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at talks, meetings and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

This code of conduct will continue to be refined as appropriate.
