# The glasgow Coder Collective

[The current site](https://glasgowcodercollective.github.io/)

## Abous Us

We are the Coder Collective! A collection of like-minded technology enthusiasts that is open to people of all (and no) experience levels. We believe programming is most productive and fun when done collectively. Come to a meeting for some social coding!

While we have our origins in web development via FreeCodeCamp we encourage anyone with an ongoing project, or even just curiosity about computers, to come see what others are working on. Later if you feel you can contribute, you can.

Our current project is the relaunch of the group website. However if you have a current computer-related project feel free to ask the group for help.

In the future we eventually plan on pooling the groupâ€™s expertise and offering a local charity to revamp their website which would serve as a learning exercise and team project and would give back to the community. Other project ideas will be considered.


### The Site Relaunch

We have big plans for the site

[Tracy](https://github.com/verde79) is helming the main page

[Ed](https://github.com/L3gomancer) is handling the profile pages section

Stretch Goals include:
- A forum
- User accounts with logins
- Polls
- Integration with Slack
- Some experiments with interactivity and animations
