# The Glasgow Coder Collective

## About Us
We are the Coder Collective! A collection of like-minded technology enthusiasts that is open to people of all (and no) experience levels. We believe programming is most productive and fun when done collectively. Come to a meeting for some social coding!

While we have our origins in web development via FreeCodeCamp we encourage anyone with an ongoing project, or even just curiosity about computers, to come see what others are working on. Later if you feel you can contribute, you can.

In the future we eventually plan on pooling the groupâ€™s expertise and offering a local charity to revamp their website which would serve as a learning exercise and team project and would give back to the community. Other project ideas will be considered.

## Branches
- master: This is the production version of the site. Merges into this branch will require the approval of two senior members.
- development: This is the development version of the site. All development code must be merged here from topic branches. Code merged here must also pass linting with no errors.
- legacy: The old version of the site.

## Issues
All issues must be added to the `Issues` section of the repository. An issue should be created when doing any work on the site. This is to ensure proper accountability and avoid duplication of effort.

## Contributing
Issues will be posted in the `Issues` section. If you want to help with an issue then you may assign yourself and begin work in a topic branch of your forked repository. Pull requests should be directed towards the development branch only and you must reference the appropriate issue in the PR.
